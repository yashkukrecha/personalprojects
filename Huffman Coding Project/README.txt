What kinds of files lead to lots of compressions?

Both text and TIF(image) files had many more compressions than the HTM files. For the text files, the files with
repeated characters led to many more compressions (these were typically found more with large amounts of text
and files like the dictionary). In TIF Files, we noticed that files that had black or white images or similar colors
next to each other compressed more than files that did not.

What kind of files had little or no compression?

The HTM files, on average, led to far less compression than the TIF files and text files. This is because, in the HTM
files, there are not many characters that repeat in frequency.

What happens when you try to compress a Huffman code file?

When I try to compress a Huffman coding file, it compresses the first time and becomes smaller, but then when
I try to compress the compressed compressed file, it increases in size every time. This is true for all the various
file types.
