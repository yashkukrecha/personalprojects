# Huffman Coding Project
### Yash Kukrecha, Anirudh Prabhu

The Huffman Coding Project involves the implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm, a variable-length prefix coding technique widely used for lossless data compression. The goal of the project is to design and develop a program that can efficiently encode and decode data by assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring symbols and longer codes to less frequent ones. This compression technique is based on constructing a binary tree, known as the Huffman tree, where the paths to the leaves represent the binary codes for each symbol. The project typically includes tasks such as analyzing the frequency distribution of symbols in a dataset, building the Huffman tree, generating the variable-length codes, and implementing encoding and decoding functions. The successful completion of the Huffman Coding Project demonstrates a solid understanding of data compression algorithms and their practical application in real-world scenarios to achieve efficient storage and transmission of information.
