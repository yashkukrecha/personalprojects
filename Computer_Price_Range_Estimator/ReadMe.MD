Computer Price Range Estimator

This folder contains the code for the project. This project aims to estimate the price of a computer within the range 0-3, 0 being the cheapest and 3 being the most expensive. Using a Sequential model, I added Dropout and Dense layers to create the CNN, and outputted the results of training the model and the predictions of the model on the test data.
